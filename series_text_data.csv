"I am genuinely so happy you asked what my favourite TV shows and series are! For me, my favourites 
would have to be shows like Sailor Moon, any series in the Pretty Cure franchise but especially Hirogaru Sky Pretty Cure,
Mermaid Melody, Cardcaptor Sakura, Tokyo Mew Mew, Fruits Basket, etc. If you couldn't already tell, I am a massive fan of shoujo 
anime and manga! Especially within the magical girl and romance department! Probably any TV and manga series within the shoujo sphere 
I most definitely will enjoy the heck out of it!

The difference between a Taylor polynomial and a Taylor series is the former is a polynomial, containing only a finite number of terms, whereas 
 
the latter is a series, a summation of an infinite set of terms. When creating the Taylor polynomial of degree n for a function  
    f(x)
  at  
    x = c
, 

we needed to evaluate  
    f
, and the first  
    n
  derivatives of  
    f
,  at  
    x = c
. 
 
When creating the Taylor series of  
    f
,  it helps to find a pattern that describes the  
    n^th
  derivative of  
    f
  at  
    x = c
. 

Let  
    f(x)
  have derivatives of all of orders at  
    x = c
. 
 
1. The Taylor Series of  
    f(x)
,  centered at  
    c
  is  
    ∑^∞_n=1f^(n)(c)/n!(x-c)^n
 

2. Setting  
    c = 0
  gives the Maclaurin Series of  
    f(x)
:  
    ∑^∞_n=1f^(n)(0)/n!x^n

There is good news. A function   that is equal to its Taylor series, centered at any point the domain of  f(x), 
 
is said to be an analytic function, and most, if not all, functions that we encounter within this course are analytic 
 
functions. Generally speaking, any function that one creates with elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials, 
 
trigonometric functions, etc.) that is not piecewise defined is probably analytic.
