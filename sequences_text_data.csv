For instance, the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., form a sequence. The order is important; the first number is 2, the second is 4 etc. 

It seems natural to seek a formula that describes a given sequence, and often this can be done. For instance, the sequence above could 

bedescribed by the function  
    a(n) = 2n
,  for the values of  
    n = 1,2,3,4,..,k
. 
 
To find the  
    10^th
  term in the sequence, we would compute  
    a(10)
.  
This leads us to the following, formal definition of a sequence.

Let  {𝐚_𝐧}  be a sequence and let  𝐋  be a real number. Given any  
ε> 0 ,  if an  𝐦  can be found such that  |𝐚_𝐧-𝐋| < ε  
for all  𝐧 > 𝐦,
 then we say the limit of  {𝐚_𝐧},  as  𝐧  
approaches infinity, is  𝐋,  denoted 
 
    lim_n→∞a_n = 𝐋
.

This definition states, informally, that if the limit of a sequence is 
 𝐋,  then if you go far enough out along the sequence, 

 all subsequent terms will be really close to  𝐋.

"Did you guys here about happened during the Annual General Meeting that happened yesterday?
It was crazy! Apparently during the meeting, there were supposed to scheduled plan that were supposed to occur where
the OTSU would go into detail about any legal information that clubs would need to stay informed about. However, there 
was a sequence of events that occured there was a student society from one of the faculties causing a lot of drama.
