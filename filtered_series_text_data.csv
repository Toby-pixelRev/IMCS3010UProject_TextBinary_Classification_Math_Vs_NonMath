"genuinely happy asked favourite tv shows series ! , favourites would shows like sailor moon , series pretty cure franchise especially hirogaru sky pretty cure , mermaid melody , cardcaptor sakura , tokyo mew mew , fruits basket , etc . could n't already tell , massive fan shoujo anime manga ! especially within magical girl romance department ! probably tv manga series within shoujo sphere definitely enjoy heck !"
"difference taylor polynomial taylor series former polynomial , containing finite number terms , whereas latter series , summation infinite set terms . creating taylor polynomial degree n function f ( x ) x = c , needed evaluate f , first n derivatives f , x = c . creating taylor series f , helps find pattern describes n^th derivative f x = c . let f ( x ) derivatives orders x = c . 1 . taylor series f ( x ) , centered c ∑^∞_n=1f^ ( n ) ( c ) /n ! ( x-c ) ^n 2 . setting c = 0 gives maclaurin series f ( x ) : ∑^∞_n=1f^ ( n ) ( 0 ) /n ! x^n"
"good news . function equal taylor series , centered point domain f ( x ) , said analytic function , , , functions encounter within course analytic functions . generally speaking , function one creates elementary functions ( polynomials , exponentials , trigonometric functions , etc . ) piecewise defined probably analytic ."
