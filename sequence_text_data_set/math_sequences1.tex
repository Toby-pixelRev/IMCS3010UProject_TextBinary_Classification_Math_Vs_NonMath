\text{For instance, the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., form a sequence. The order is important; the first number is 2, the second is 4 etc.} \\
\text{It seems natural to seek a formula that describes a given sequence, and often this can be done. For instance, the sequence above could} \\
\text{bedescribed by the function} \ \begin{equation}a(n) = 2n\end{equation}, \ \text{for the values of} \ \begin{equation}n = 1,2,3,4,..,k\end{equation}. \\ 
\text{To find the} \ \begin{equation}10^{th}\end{equation} \ \text{term in the sequence, we would compute} \ \begin{equation}a(10)\end{equation}. \ 
\text{This leads us to the following, formal definition of a sequence.} \\
