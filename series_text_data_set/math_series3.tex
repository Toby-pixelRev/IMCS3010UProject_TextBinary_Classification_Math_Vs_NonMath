\text{There is good news. A function   that is equal to its Taylor series, centered at any point the domain of} \ f(x), \\ 
\text{is said to be an analytic function, and most, if not all, functions that we encounter within this course are analytic} \\ 
\text{functions. Generally speaking, any function that one creates with elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials,} \\ 
\text{trigonometric functions, etc.) that is not piecewise defined is probably analytic.} \\
